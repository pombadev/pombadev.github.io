# Hi there :wave:

My name is Pomba Magar, I'm a Christian and I live in Kathmandu, Nepal :nepal: with my wife and daughter.

I love programming, opensource, linux & coffee.

I enjoy statically typed [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language))-*ish* programming languages.

All my opensource works can be found in either [github](https://github.com/pombadev) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/pombadev).
